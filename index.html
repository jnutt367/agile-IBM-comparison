        <h2>Ok! Here is a direct comparison as from conception until the current age...</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <h1>AGILE BEGINNINGS</h1>
        <h3>The four core values of Agile software development as stated by the Agile Manifesto are: </h3>
        <h2 style="color:red">individuals and interactions over processes and tools;</h2>
        <h2><span style="color:green">working software </span></h2>
        <h3>over comprehensive documentation; </h3>
        <h2><span style="color:green">customer collaboration</span></h2>
        <h3> over contract negotiation; </h3>
        <h3>and.</h3>

        <h2>Well so far, the comparison draws many similarities. The overall theme being customer's (user's happiness) satisfaction is of primary importance, and then relationships between teammates, then tools and processes.</h2>

    <h1>Complexity and ambiguity</h1>
    <p>Enterprise teams deal with complex ecosystems that take years to learn and master.</p>
    <p> They offer countless rabbit holes, worm holes, plot holes, pot holes, and any other kind of ambiguous situations you can think of.</p>
    <p> Finding enough clarity to decide on the best thing to do within this intricate web can sometimes seem impossible.
    </p>
    <p>But, it doesn’t have to be so hard.</p>
    <p> Finding clarity can be as simple as focusing on the most important thing. </p>
    <p>In design thinking, the most important thing is people. </p>
    <p>In Enterprise Design Thinking, we call this a focus on user outcomes.</p>
    <h2>A focus on user outcomes
    </h2>
    <h3>When you focus your team and your work around your users and their needs, you’re able to more easily decide what’s important.</h3>
    <h3>This makes your offerings more essential to the people who use them. If all you did was ask:</h3>
    <h2>Who are our users?</h2>
    <h2>What is their current experience?</h2>
    <h2>How could it be improved?</h2>
    <h3>over and over again, you would get closer and closer to understanding your users and creating an ideal future for them. </h3>
    <h3>This allows you to put a more valuable offering into your client’s hands and into the market.</h3>

    <div class="card2">
        <h1>Business problems to human-centered problems</h1>
        <h2>Business problems, like those you are asked to solve day to day, are often focused on something nonhuman, like the bottom line or brand recognition.</h2>
        <h2>In order to start focusing on your users, you have to identify the user problems that underlie the business problem.
        </h2>

        <h1>Uncover the problem</h1>
        <h2>Always be asking why</h2>
        <h2>Focusing on users and their problems can help make it more straightforward.</h2>
